# GoogleSheetsDiscordBot
 
This is a new version of the bot that I made for my AP Computer Science class because I was bored and the class wasn't hard enough already. If you want help with this thing READ THE PREFACE in bot.js and configure it in config.json. Atom is recommended, although it is not required. 

This is too much README text, so I'll just tell you to go to https://sites.google.com/prod/site/aidanssiteofstuff/googlespreadsheetsdiscordbot and read what I have there, which is more descriptive than what's here. Also it looks prettier there!

If you are still having trouble and you have read the preface, or if you avoid reading at all costs, then contact me.
